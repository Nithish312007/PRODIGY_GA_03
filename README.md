🧠 Text Generation using Markov Chains

(Task 03 – Prodigy InfoTech Generative AI Internship)

📌 Project Description

This project demonstrates a simple text generation system using Markov Chains.
The model learns patterns from a given text and generates new sentences by predicting the next word based on the previous one.
This task helps in understanding how probabilistic models like Markov Chains work in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and forms the foundation for advanced text generation techniques.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3

Standard Python Libraries (random, collections)

⚙️ How It Works

Input text is provided to the program.
The text is split into words.
A Markov Chain is built where each word maps to possible next words.
A new sentence is generated by randomly selecting the next word based on learned patterns.

▶️ How to Run the Code

Make sure Python is installed.
Open terminal or command prompt.
Run the file using:
TASK_3.py
The generated text will be displayed in the terminal.
